    1Blend the banana, oats, eggs, milk, baking powder, cinnamon, and protein powder in a blender for 1-2 mins until smooth. Check the oats have broken down, if not, blend for another minute.
    2Heat a drizzle of either low calorie nonstick spray or coconut oil in a pan. Pour or ladle in 2-3 rounds of batter, leaving a little space between each to spread. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until bubbles start to appear on the surface and the underside is golden. Flip over and cook for another minute until cooked through. Transfer to a warmed oven and repeat with the remaining batter. Serve in stacks with preferred topping.
