    1. Boil your rice with a pinch of salt and turmeric.
    2. Add your favorite frozen vegetable wok mix to a wok and grill until the vegetables no longer are frozen.
    3. Add your preferred source of protein and a touch of sesame oil (I use tofu. You can use chicken for a greater protein to calorie ratio)
    4. Season with your favorite spices. (I recommend salt, pepper, chili, curry, turmeric, paprika and soy). Grill until golden and cooked through.
    5. Add light coconut milk and red curry past to the wok and get to a boil. Let simmer for 5-10 min.
