    1. Preheat convection oven to 200Â°C.
    2. Season your salmon fillet with preferred seasoning. (I recommend olive oil, salt, pepper, paprika and chili).
    3. Place the salmon fillet in the oven and let it cook for minimum 14 minutes. (Depending on how you prefer your fish).
    4. While the salmon is cooking, prepare your salad by chopping and mixing the given vegetables as desired. Then add the strawberries and the feta, olive, garlic mix.
    5. When the salmon done, remove the skin from the fish and add it to your salad. You can top your fresh and healthy salad off with 5g of sriracha if desired.
