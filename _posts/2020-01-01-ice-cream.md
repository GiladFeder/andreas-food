  ingredients_markdown: |-
    * 100g frozen banana
    * 35g protein powder

  directions_markdown: |-
    1.	Blend frozen banana, whey protein, low-fat yoghurt, and a splash of milk together until they're just about smooth, without overprocessing. Add more milk if necessary. Be careful not to add too much milk or overprocess the mixture as it will make it too liquified, which means you won't be able to eat it straight away. (I recommend vanilla and white chocolate protein powder).
    2.	Top with favorite fruit and protein glaze (mix 5g of favorite protein with a splash of water until glaze like texture).
    3.	Enjoy.

Delicious!
