    1. Start by boiling your pasta with a pinch of salt.
    2. Chop your red onion, garlic and carrot into desired shape/size and add to a pan together with the meatless minced meat and a touch of olive oil. (I recommend a meatless meat based on milk protein).
    3. Season the ingredients with salt, pepper, and preferred spices and grill until golden. (I recommend chili, paprika and Provence-mix).
    4. Add 150g of chopped tomato sauce to the pan and let it simmer for 5-10min. (If desired, you can add half a cube of vegetable stock to the bolognaise for more taste).
    5. Serve with parsley, basil and or low-fat shredded cheese.
    6. Enjoy.
