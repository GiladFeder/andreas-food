    1.	First, prepare the batter by spraying a large, microwave-safe mug with low calorie nonstick spray. Place your dry ingredients into it and mix well. (I recommend chocolate brownie protein powder) Add your egg and milk and mix until a smooth batter remains. Add chocolate chips if desired.
    1. Start by adding the oats and a pinch of salt to a bowl. Add water so it covers the oats with around one centimeter.
    2. Microwave the oats for 1½-2½ minutes on max until the mixture becomes a substantial porridge.
    3. Add blueberries, low-fat yoghurt and your favorite protein powder to the oats and mix well. (I recommend vanilla, cookies/cream and white chocolate protein powder). Add a pinch of stevia or sugar free syrup if desired.
    4. Chop and add banana and granola on top of your oatmeal. Finnish up by sprinkling the cinnamon and the peanut butter over the meal.
    5. Enjoy.
