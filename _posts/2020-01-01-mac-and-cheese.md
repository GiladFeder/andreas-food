  directions_markdown: |-
    1. Start by boiling your macaroni with a pinch of salt. (I recommend oat-based macaroni).
    2. Add 100g of your favorite veggie-mix to a wok and grill until colored. (I like to use ready-to-use pre-washed, chopped, and peeled vegetables for faster cooking. A mix of bell pepper, carrot, red onion, and sugar peas).
    3. Slice the chicken and add to the wok together with olive oil. Season well with salt, pepper, and other preferred spices. (I recommend; garlic powder, curry, turmeric, and thyme). Grill for approximately 10 minutes until chicken is cooked through.
    4. Add the pasta and cream cheese to the wok and spice it up with a touch of sriracha.
    5. Enjoy.
    4.	Enjoy.
