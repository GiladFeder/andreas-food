  directions_markdown: |-
    1.	First, prepare the batter by spraying a large, microwave-safe mug with low calorie nonstick spray. Place your dry ingredients into it and mix well. (I recommend chocolate brownie protein powder) Add your egg and milk and mix until a smooth batter remains. Add chocolate chips if desired.
    2.	Microwave the batter for 60 seconds to get a soft center of your brownie.
    3.	Top with berries and protein glaze (mix 5g of favorite protein with a splash of water until glaze like texture).
    4.	Enjoy.
